# Formula-student-EV-capacity-calculation
This is a simple physics model to determine the required battery capacity of an EV (electric vehicle) for formula student based upon speed-time data for the formula student endurance event. This model does not take into account regenerative braking. 

[Capacity calculations explanation.pdf](https://github.com/chris-cooper3/Formula-student-EV-capacity-calculation/files/7171135/Capacity.calculations.explanation.pdf) - Explanation of the physics model and calculations in the python code.

##Instructions:
1. Add your speed-time data into the drive cycle sheet of the excel spreadhseet. Make sure this is speed (mph) - time (seconds)
2. Add your car data in the the car data sheet of the excel spreadhseet
3. Run the script.
