# Formula-student-EV-capacity-calculation
This is a simple physics model to determine the required battery capacity of an EV for formula student based upon speed-time data. This model does not take into account regenerative braking. 

[Capacity calculations explanation.pdf](https://github.com/chris-cooper3/Formula-student-EV-capacity-calculation/files/7171135/Capacity.calculations.explanation.pdf) - Explanation of the physics model and calculations in the python code.

##Instructions:
1. Add your speed-time data into the drive cycle sheet of the excel spreadhseet. Make sure this is speed (mph) - time (seconds)
2. Add your car data in the the car data sheet of the excel spreadhseet
3. Add your path to the excel spreadsheet in line 19 and line 34. Don't change the sheet name.  
4  Run the script.
